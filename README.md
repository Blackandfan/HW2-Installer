Modified version of ankoh's Maethrillian Installer for the hw2 maethrillian project. Any credit for this work goes to him.

## Projects

The repository contains two entry points that target .NET Framework 4.8

* **MaethrillianInstaller.Shell** – console-based workflow that mirrors the original script behaviour.
* **MaethrillianInstaller.Desktop** – Windows Forms interface packaged with the same installer logic.
